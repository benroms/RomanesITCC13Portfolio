After deploying my portfolio, I observed some clear differences between GitHub Pages and Netlify. GitHub Pages was straightforward to use for my static HTML and CSS site. The setup involved uploading my files to the repository and enabling Pages in the settings, which took only a few minutes. However, updates sometimes take a little longer to appear, and there is no visual indication of a build process—it simply publishes the files.

Netlify, on the other hand, provided a faster and more interactive experience. I could deploy my site by dragging and dropping the folder, and the live preview appeared almost instantly. Netlify also shows build logs and allows easy connection to GitHub for automatic deployments. Its user interface is very intuitive, and managing the site, including domain settings, felt more professional and flexible.

Overall, I prefer Netlify for deploying web projects because it is faster, provides clear feedback on the deployment process, and supports additional features if I want to expand my portfolio in the future. GitHub Pages is still great for simple static sites, but Netlify gives a smoother workflow and more control.
